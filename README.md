# wordle-clone

Wordle Clone built from Real-Python tutorial  
https://realpython.com/python-wordle-clone/


## Commit History
The commit history tracks each incremental change in building this command-line based Wordle game.
However, there may be slight differences from the order in the tutorial as I didn't notice some earlier changes that were made and fixed them on later commits.
If you follow along to both this repository and the tutorial, know that if a change is made in the tutorial it will eventually show up in this repo's commit history.

## How to Run
See the Real Python repository (link below) for instructions on how to run this program. Use `requirements.txt` to create a virtual environment, containing all dependencies needed to run the game.
